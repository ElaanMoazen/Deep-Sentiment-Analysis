# Deep Sentiment Analysis

This project implements a deep learning model for sentiment analysis using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The model is trained to classify the sentiment of text data into positive or negative categories.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of analyzing and understanding the sentiment expressed in text data. It involves determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

In this project, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, to perform sentiment analysis. The model takes as input sequences of text data and predicts the sentiment associated with each sequence.

## Features

- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning implementation
- Preprocesses text data using tokenization and padding
- Embeds words into dense vectors using an embedding layer
- Constructs an RNN model with LSTM units for sequence processing
- Compiles the model with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
- Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy for model performance assessment
